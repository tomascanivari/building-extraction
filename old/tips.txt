Nice — this is a well-specified competition. I put together a practical, end-to-end plan you can use (and run) right away: recommended modeling approaches, training/augmentation strategies, postprocessing, local evaluation (object-wise IoU matching + F1), and a couple of ready-to-run Python utilities you’ll find handy (evaluation and submission writer). If you want, I can convert any of the code below into files / a notebook next.

Quick strategy overview (what wins this kind of challenge)

Start with a strong instance segmentation baseline (easy to get good F1 quickly) — e.g. Mask R-CNN (Detectron2 / MMDetection) or Mask2Former / Mask R-CNN ensemble.

Train on the Tokyo-sourced train/val, use COCO-format annotations already provided.

Polygons from masks: convert predicted masks → contours → polygon simplification → ensure valid geometry (ccw, no self-intersections). That gives you the building boundary vertices required by the task.

Refine for generalization: heavy augmentation (geometric + photometric), CutMix-like mixes, domain randomization (color jitter, haze, blur), multi-scale training, random crops/tiling so the model sees different contexts.

Domain adaptation / extra data (allowed): use OSM footprint data and other public datasets only if aligned and used automatically (no manual dataset creation). Use pseudo-labeling on unlabeled Plateau images (automatic) with confidence thresholds, then fine-tune.

Ensemble + TTA: average predictions from model checkpoints (and possibly different architectures), plus test-time augmentations (flip + scale), then merge masks with NMS / mask voting.

Postprocessing: remove tiny contours, merge split pieces (morphology), snap vertices to more geometric shapes if appropriate, simplify polygons with Ramer–Douglas–Peucker.

Eval locally: implement object-wise IoU matching (IoU ≥ 0.5 for TP). Use Hungarian matching to avoid double-counting. Compute precision, recall, F1 exactly as competition requires — validate your pipeline end-to-end before submitting.

Modeling choices — short list (from easiest → advanced)

Mask R-CNN (Detectron2 or MMDetection) — good baseline, fast to iterate, mature code.

Mask2Former / SegFormer + instance head — modern transformer-based segmentation with good generalization.

Polyline/polygon-specific models: Polygon-RNN++, Curve-GCN, DeepSnake, or Seg2Polys methods — can produce smoother polygon vertices directly (more work to set up).

Keypoint- or corner-based: CornerNet/CenterNet variants + polygon assembly — useful if buildings are rectilinear.

Ensembling: combine Mask R-CNN + Mask2Former predictions for robustness.

Augmentation & training tips (important for cross-region generalization)

Geometric: random rotations (±15–45°), flips, random crops, scale jittering.

Photometric: brightness, contrast, color jitter, small Gaussian blur, JPEG compression artifacts.

Context: random erasing, mixup/CutMix with background patches.

Spatial: random perspective, random channel shuffling, slight fog/haze simulation.

Use balanced sampling across urban/suburban/rural tiles so model sees varied densities.

Use mosaic tiling or sliding windows for large images, but ensure no annotation leakage between training/validation.

Postprocessing and submission format details

Convert predicted mask → polygon using cv2.findContours (binary mask). Keep the largest contour for each connected component (or split into multiple buildings if multiple components).

Simplify polygon using shapely.geometry.Polygon.simplify(tolerance) or RDP to reduce vertex count (preserve IoU).

Ensure vertex order is consistent (clockwise or ccw) and polygons are valid (no self intersections).

Save coordinates as strings "[ (x0,y0), (x1,y1), ... ]" exactly like the sample_submission; if none detected, store [].

Ensure ImageID matches the provided image naming rule (e.g., 1 for 0001.jpg if that's how the sample expects it).
